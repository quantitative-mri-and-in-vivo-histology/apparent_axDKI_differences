However, for any beta that is greater than zero both transformations will be invertible.

To this end, the field-inhomogeneity estimated from the non-diffusion weighted images is used as a starting guess for minimization of the distance between the respective diffusion-weighted image pairs.

%{
Choose parameter theta that balances between the data fit and the smoothness of the cubic B-spline approximation of the image data. For theta equal to zero a standard cubic B-spline interpolation is used. For positive theta data is only approximated, but the image representation is smoother. Thus, theta can be used to adjust for noise level of the data. Note that this scheme is only used for the optimization and in particular that the corrected image data is obtained by resampling using a standard tri-linear interpolation.

%{
Choose data dimensions that are coarsened in multilevel optimization.

Background: To accelerate computations and improve robustness against local minima, we use a multilevel
strategy for optimization. One part of this is to represent the image data by coarsened versions using averaging.
This setting affects which dimensions are coarsened.

Default: [1,1,1] coarsens data along all coordinate directions

Example: choosing [1,1,0] avoids coarsening along the third direction (commonly, the slice selection direction).
This choice is motivated by the fact that EPI distortions are typically restricted within slices.

Note: This flag does not affect the final resolution of the estimated inhomogeneity, which will be
related to the number of voxels in the original image data.
